🎓 Student Record Management System 📚

Welcome to the Student Record Management System, a simple Java project designed to demonstrate the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project allows you to manage student records using features like add, delete, update, search, and display, all while showcasing OOP principles in action.

💡 OOP Concepts Covered

 1. Inheritance 📜: An abstract Person class is inherited by the Student class.

 2. Polymorphism 🔄: Method overriding demonstrated with displayInfo() in the Student class.

 3. Abstraction 🔒: The RecordManager interface manages records without revealing implementation details.

 4. Encapsulation 🔐: The Student and Record classes encapsulate data and behavior.

 5. Interfaces 🤝: The RecordManager interface sets a contract for classes like StudentRecordManagement.
